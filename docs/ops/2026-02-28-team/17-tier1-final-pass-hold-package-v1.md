# Tier 1 Premium PDF — Final PASS/HOLD Package v1

- **Date/Time (PT):** 2026-02-28 03:30
- **Owner:** Elena (Principal Planner)
- **Scope:** Camila + Owen + Mateo review cycle
- **Status:** **HOLD** (pending required edits)

## Why HOLD (plain-language)
The package is visually strong and close to release, but a few decision and wording items still need cleanup so council/client readers can trust the recommendation without confusion.

## Required Edits Before PASS (must complete)
1. **Make the Concept B choice fully clear**
   - In the comparison panel, either fix the scores or add weighted scoring + one sentence explaining why Concept B is the best balanced option.

2. **Use motion-ready council action wording**
   - Recommended Action must say exactly what to approve now, what Phase 1 budget range is authorized, and when staff returns before Phase 2.

3. **Apply plain-English replacements consistently**
   - Replace jargon terms (ROM, quick-build, crossing exposure, curb-use conflict, frontage comfort, CIP abbreviation, shorthand score labels) using canonical v2 edit set:
   - `openplan/docs/ops/2026-02-28-team/16-mateo-readability-pass-v2-edit-set.md`

4. **Capability one-pager release hygiene**
   - Ensure direct contact is present and disclosure language remains clear for conceptual/synthetic examples when used.

## Strengths Already Confirmed
- Clear decision-first structure
- Executive/council-readable hierarchy
- Professional visual polish and consistency

## Release-Note Caveats (required)
Use this or equivalent plain-language disclosure in release notes:

> This is a concept-level planning package for direction-setting. It is not a survey, engineering, or construction document. Cost and outcome values are preliminary planning estimates and may change after technical and field verification. Funding awards and regulatory approvals are not guaranteed.

## PASS Criteria
Mark **PASS** only after all four required edits are applied in Tier 1 v2 files and principal re-review confirms no remaining blockers.

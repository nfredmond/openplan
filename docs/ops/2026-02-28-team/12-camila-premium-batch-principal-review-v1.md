# Principal Review — Camila Premium PDF Batch v1

- **Date/Time (PT):** 2026-02-28 02:12
- **Reviewer:** Elena Marquez (Principal Planner)
- **Scope reviewed:**
  - `tier1_old_mill_premium_client_brief_v1`
  - `tier1_old_mill_premium_council_cover_v1`
  - `tier1_natford_capability_premium_v1`
- **Review lens:** decision clarity, non-technical readability, visual hierarchy, council/client professionalism

## Must-Fix (before client/council release)
1. **Decision logic conflict in concept comparison panel (client brief).**
   - Current A/B/C values imply C or A leads in several criteria while Recommendation selects B.
   - Required fix: add weighted criteria + one-line rationale for B as best balanced option, or revise displayed scores.

2. **Motion language must be council-action-ready (council cover).**
   - Current recommended action is strong but not yet fully procedural.
   - Required fix: convert to action motion format: approve direction, authorize Phase 1 up to an amount or ROM-bound, require return report date/trigger.

3. **Capability statement needs direct contact channel beyond website.**
   - Add professional email and/or phone for executive usability.
   - If mock/synthetic outcomes are included, include explicit synthetic disclaimer where appropriate.

## Should-Fix (high value, not blocking if time-constrained)
1. **Add methods/assumptions micro-strip** on brief + council cover (data basis + conceptual status).
2. **Increase legibility for dense body text** (slight size/line-height increase in summary and outcome blocks).
3. **Add “Next Step” panel back into premium brief** (owner, timing, and immediate decision dependency).
4. **Tighten wording consistency** (choose one style for “Phase 1 pilot design + quick-build” and use consistently).

## Good-to-Go
1. **Visual hierarchy is premium and coherent** across all three pieces.
2. **Decision-first framing is strong** (ask appears early, supporting logic follows).
3. **Council/client tone is appropriately professional** and free of technical clutter.
4. **Color system and spacing discipline** communicate credibility and polish.

## Sign-off / Blockers
- **Status:** CONDITIONAL SIGN-OFF
- **Release gate:** clear Must-Fix items #1–#3
- **Blockers:** none structural beyond the listed must-fix content edits

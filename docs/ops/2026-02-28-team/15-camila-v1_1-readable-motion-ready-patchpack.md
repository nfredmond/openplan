# Camila v1.1 Readability + Motion-Ready Patch Pack

Prepared by: Owen Park (Associate Planner)  
Date: 2026-02-28  
Purpose: provide copy-paste edits that close principal must-fix items and non-technical readability gaps for Tier 1 ship set.

Canonical dependencies:
- Tier 1 alignment: `13-tier1-ship-set-alignment.md`
- Principal must-fix text: `14-camila-v1_1-must-fix-patchtext.md`
- Assistant readability review: `agents/team/assistant-planner/pdf_polish_readability_review_2026-02-28_batch1.md`

---

## A) Client Brief (`tier1_old_mill_premium_client_brief_v1`)

### 1) Concept comparison title
Replace with:
**Concept comparison (A/B/C • weighted decision lens)**

### 2) Add decision rule directly under title
Add line:
**Decision rule:** prioritize safety + ADA + operational compatibility over lowest first-cost.

### 3) Replace score block with plain-labeled weighted lines
Use:
- Safety score (35%): Option A = 3, Option B = 4, Option C = 5
- ADA comfort score (25%): Option A = 3, Option B = 5, Option C = 5
- Operations compatibility score (25%): Option A = 5, Option B = 4, Option C = 3
- Cost-effectiveness score (15%): Option A = 5, Option B = 4, Option C = 2

### 4) Add rationale line under scores
Add:
**Why Concept B:** highest balanced score across safety/accessibility gains, delivery risk, and operational continuity for near-term implementation.

### 5) Plain-language micro-edits
- “crossing exposure” -> “pedestrian crossing risk”
- “capital efficiency” -> “cost-effectiveness for the benefits delivered”
- “Funding alignment (draft)” -> “Potential funding sources (draft)”
- “phased local CIP match strategy” -> “phased local Capital Improvement Program match strategy”

---

## B) Council Cover (`tier1_old_mill_premium_council_cover_v1`)

### 1) Replace Recommended Action block (motion-ready)
Use:
**Adopt Concept B as the preferred corridor direction; authorize Phase 1 pilot design and rapid, temporary implementation for two priority blocks at a planning estimate (rough order of magnitude) of $0.8M–$1.6M; and direct staff to return with a pilot performance + technical feasibility update before Phase 2 authorization.**

### 2) Plain-language line edits
- “planning ROM” -> “planning estimate (rough order of magnitude)”
- “quick-build implementation” -> “rapid, temporary implementation”
- “crossing exposure” -> “pedestrian crossing risk”
- “curb-use conflict” -> “conflicts over curb use (parking/loading)”
- “frontage comfort gaps” -> “sidewalk comfort gaps”

### 3) Optional methods strip (recommended)
Add small note block:
**Methods note:** Concept-level package informed by desktop/GIS screening and planning assumptions; values shown are preliminary and subject to field verification during technical refinement.

---

## C) Capability One-Pager (`tier1_natford_capability_premium_v1`)

### 1) Replace contact line
Use:
**Contact: nathaniel@natfordplanning.com • natfordplanning.com • California, USA**

### 2) Add disclosure footer
Use:
**Portfolio examples shown may include conceptual/synthetic mock representations prepared for planning communication and internal workflow demonstration.**

### 3) Optional clarity tune (if space allows)
- “Program delivery support from concept through pilot execution” ->
  “Program delivery support from concept through pilot launch”

---

## D) Final pre-ship check (must pass)
- [ ] Concept B rationale is explicit and consistent with score panel
- [ ] Council Recommended Action reads as a formal motion
- [ ] Jargon replacements applied in decision-facing lines
- [ ] Contact + disclosure present on capability one-pager
- [ ] Footer disclaimer remains: concept-level, not survey/engineering/construction docs

## Mission
Support Camila’s design sprint by preparing implementation-ready planning structure and visual review inputs so the +24h and +48h checkpoints convert cleanly into build-ready tasks.

## Deliverables (next 24h)
1. **Top-5 Screen Inventory + Evidence Pack**
   - Build a concise inventory for: dashboard, scenario comparison, report/export, map/results, onboarding.
   - For each: current-state notes, friction points, and screenshot placeholders/paths.

2. **Design-to-Implementation Intake Sheet**
   - Create a one-page template that engineering can use to intake each Camila component/screen decision.
   - Required fields: component name, intended behavior, state list, token dependencies, accessibility notes, acceptance checks.

3. **Checkpoint Review Prep (for Elena)**
   - Draft structured review prompts for Camila’s +24h checkpoint.
   - Separate: clarifications, scope risks, and “ready now” items.

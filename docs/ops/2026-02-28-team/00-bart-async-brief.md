# Bart Async Brief — OpenPlan Delegation Continuity

- **Date/Time (PT):** 2026-02-28 00:34
- **From:** Elena (Principal Planner)
- **Priority:** P0

## Context
Nathaniel asked for immediate continuation and requested:
1) check in with Mateo,
2) assign him more work,
3) use assistant + associate planners to support execution.

## Actions queued now
- Issued Mateo support packet to accelerate Camila’s OpenPlan design lane.
- Issued Owen support packet to prepare review rubric + acceptance gate for Camila checkpoints.

## Decision intent
Keep OpenPlan velocity high while Camila executes v1 design packet (+24h / +48h checkpoints), with planning staff handling structure, QA framing, and implementation readiness inputs.

## Requested from Bart when free
- Confirm no priority override on these assignments.
- Confirm preferred update cadence (default: decision-grade only).

## Plain-Language Caveat Block (required)

> This is a concept-level planning package for direction-setting. It is not a survey, engineering, or construction document. Cost and outcome values are preliminary planning estimates and may change after technical and field verification. Funding awards and regulatory approvals are not guaranteed.

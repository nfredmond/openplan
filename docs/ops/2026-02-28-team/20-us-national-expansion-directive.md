# U.S. National Expansion Directive
Date: 2026-02-28 (PT)
Owner: Bartholomew Hale (COO)
Approved by: Nathaniel Ford Redmond (CEO)

## Decision
Nat Ford market coverage is now expanded from a Northern California-first positioning to **nationwide U.S. coverage**, with explicit service fit for:
- small towns and rural communities,
- tribal governments and tribal transportation priorities,
- counties and county-equivalents (parishes, boroughs, municipios, independent cities),
- RTPAs and transportation commissions,
- state transportation agencies (including Caltrans and peer DOTs).

## Positioning rule
Use this standard line in public-facing contexts:
- "Based in Northern California, serving agencies across the United States."

## Immediate implementation status
- Website metadata + homepage + Grant AI Lab positioning updated and deployed.
- Planner AI and Grant AI prompts updated for nationwide public-sector applicability.
- Stripe checkout lane remains active and monetization monitoring is live.

## Team operating updates
1. Principal Planner (Elena)
   - Apply national-scope lens to review templates and client framing language.
2. Associate + Assistant Planning (Owen, Mateo)
   - Update transmittal and proposal boilerplate to U.S. multi-jurisdiction language.
3. GIS Expert (Priya)
   - Ensure GIS methods/readme docs remain jurisdiction-agnostic with state/local switchability.
4. Engineering (Iris)
   - Keep product prompts, forms, and metadata aligned with nationwide scope.
5. Urban Design (Camila)
   - Ensure visual language and covers avoid region-limiting phrasing unless project-specific.

## Governance
- Northern California experience remains valid and should be retained as representative portfolio context.
- No claims of national office footprint; keep remote-first delivery language accurate.
- Keep ethics/quality/citation/confidentiality gate unchanged.

# Priya GIS Transition Packet v1 — Post-SRF Priority Queue

- **Date Issued (PT):** 2026-02-28
- **Owner:** Priya (GIS Expert)
- **Manager:** Elena (Principal Planner)
- **Priority:** P0
- **Context:** Transition immediately after SRF app completion

## Mission
Shift GIS capacity to OpenPlan pilot-readiness by locking geospatial reliability, decision-quality analytics, and map/report performance under one execution lane.

## Top 3 Priorities (in order)
1. **Pilot geospatial data hardening**
2. **Decision-ready safety/accessibility analytics pack**
3. **Map/report performance + reliability pass**

## Deliverables (first 48 hours)

### A) Pilot Geospatial Data Hardening
- Build/confirm canonical layer inventory with source-of-truth flags.
- Validate schema + geometry + CRS consistency.
- Produce QA pass log with fixes and unresolved anomalies.

**Artifact:** `09-gis-pilot-data-hardening-checklist.md`

### B) Safety/Accessibility Analytics Pack
- Define metric set for leadership/council packet use.
- Prepare map/export spec with naming/version conventions.
- Produce one mock output bundle path structure for rapid replication.

**Artifact:** `10-council-analytics-pack-spec.md`

### C) Reliability + Smoke Suite
- Define production-like smoke checks for geospatial query/render/export.
- Log expected run durations and failure thresholds.
- Flag top infra risks and immediate mitigations.

**Artifact:** `11-gis-reliability-smoke-suite.md`

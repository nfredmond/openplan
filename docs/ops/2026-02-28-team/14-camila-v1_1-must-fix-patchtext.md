# Camila v1.1 Must-Fix Patch Text (Copy/Paste Ready)

- **Prepared by:** Elena (Principal Planner)
- **Purpose:** close must-fix gate items from principal review for Tier 1 ship set

## 1) Client Brief — Concept Comparison Panel (decision traceability)
### Replace panel title with:
**Concept comparison (A/B/C • weighted decision lens)**

### Add this line directly under title:
**Decision rule:** prioritize safety + ADA + operational compatibility over lowest first-cost.

### Replace current score block with:
- Safety uplift (35%): A3 • B4 • C5
- ADA comfort (25%): A3 • B5 • C5
- Operational compatibility (25%): A5 • B4 • C3
- Capital efficiency (15%): A5 • B4 • C2

### Add this rationale line under scores:
**Why Concept B:** highest balanced score across safety/accessibility gains, delivery risk, and operational continuity for near-term implementation.

---

## 2) Council Cover — Motion-Ready Recommended Action
### Replace current Recommended Action block with:
**Adopt Concept B as the preferred corridor direction; authorize Phase 1 pilot design and quick-build implementation for two priority blocks at planning-level ROM ($0.8M–$1.6M); and direct staff to return with a pilot performance + technical feasibility update before Phase 2 authorization.**

---

## 3) Capability One-Pager — Contact + disclosure cleanup
### Replace contact line with:
**Contact: nathaniel@natfordplanning.com • natfordplanning.com • California, USA**

### Add footer disclosure line:
**Portfolio examples shown may include conceptual/synthetic mock representations prepared for planning communication and internal workflow demonstration.**

---

## 4) Optional but recommended (high-value, non-blocking)
### Add methods/assumptions micro-strip (brief + council cover):
**Methods note:** Concept-level package informed by desktop/GIS screening and planning assumptions; values shown are preliminary and subject to field verification during technical refinement.

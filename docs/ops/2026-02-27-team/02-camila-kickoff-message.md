## Immediate scope (v1)
1. Visual direction one-pager (palette/type/spacing/icon+map style)
2. Core component style set with states
3. Top-5 screen polish pass (dashboard, scenarios, report/export, map/results, onboarding)
4. Brand mini-pack (3 demo covers + 1 executive screenshot template)
5. Engineering handoff spec (tokens + naming + ready checklist)

## Check-in cadence
- **Checkpoint 1 (24h):** direction + component draft
- **Checkpoint 2 (48h):** full v1 packet + handoff

## Required check-in format
- Completed

Let’s keep this clean, fast, and implementation-ready.
